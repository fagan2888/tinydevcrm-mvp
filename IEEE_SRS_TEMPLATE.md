# IEEE Software Requirements Specification Template

Copyright 1999 Karl E. Wiegers

I believe this document (translated from [PDF](srs_template-ieee.pdf) to
Markdown for better parsing support, performance, and blob size) complies with
[IEEE Standard 830-1998](IEEE-Std-830-1998.pdf) defined best practices, and I
plan to apply this documentation standard for TinyDevCRM going forward into
product development.

*Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when
writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance.
