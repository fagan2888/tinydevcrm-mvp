# Process Evolution

I believe automating creation, modification, and deprecation / deletion of
certain software development processes can accelerate the pace of product
development, which given the short timespan to create this product may mean the
difference between getting to feature parity and making the product usable for
the foreseeable future, and dead vaporware.

This document seeks to record different ways to evolve processes. No judgment is
levied for or against any of them. These act as heuristics for whatever
eventually goes, and checkpoints to compare against existing process and process
evolution techniques against.

## [Capability Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model)

Five monotonic [maturity levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_model):

1.  *Initial* (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point for use
    of a new or undocumented repeat process.

    It is characteristic of processes at this level that they are (typically)
    undocumented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an
    *ad hoc*, uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides
    a chaotic or unstable environment for the processes. For example, a surgeon
    performing a new operation a small number of times.

2.  *Repeatable* - the process is at least documented sufficiently such that
    repeating the same steps may be attempted.

    It is characteristic of this level of maturity that some processes are
    repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely
    to be rigorous, but where it exists it may help to ensure that existing
    processes are maintained during times of stress.

3.  *Defined* - the process is defined / confirmed as a standard [business
    process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process)

    It is characteristic of processes at this level that there are sets of
    defined and documented standard processes established and subject to some
    degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place. The
    processes may not have been systematically or repeatedly used - sufficient
    for the users to become competent or the process to be validated in a range
    of situations. This could be considered a developmental stage - with use in
    a wider range of conditions and user competence development the process can
    develop to next level of maturity.

4.  *Capable / Managed* - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance
    with agreed-upon metrics.

    It is characteristic of processes at this level that, using process metrics,
    effective achievement of the process objectives can be evidenced across a
    range of operational conditions. The suitability of the process in multiple
    environments has been tested and the process refined and adapted. Process
    users have experienced the process in multiple and varied conditions, and
    are able to demonstrate experience. The process maturity enables adaptations
    to particular projects without measurable losses of quality or deviations
    from specifications. Process capability is established from this level. For
    example, a surgeon performing an operation hundreds of times with levels of
    negative outcomes approaching zero.

5.  *Efficient* - process management includes deliberate process optimization /
    improvement.

    It is characteristic of processes at this level that the focus is on
    continually improving process performance through both incremental and
    innovative technological changes / improvements.

    Addresses common causes of process variation, done at the same ltime as
    maintaining likelihood of achieving established quantitative process
    improvement objectives.
