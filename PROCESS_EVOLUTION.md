# Process Evolution

I believe automating creation, modification, and deprecation / deletion of
certain software development processes can accelerate the pace of product
development, which given the short timespan to create this product may mean the
difference between getting to feature parity and making the product usable for
the foreseeable future, and dead vaporware.

This document seeks to record different ways to evolve processes. No judgment is
levied for or against any of them. These act as heuristics for whatever
eventually goes, and checkpoints to compare against existing process and process
evolution techniques against.
