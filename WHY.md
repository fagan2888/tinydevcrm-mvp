# Why TinyDevCRM?

I read through [this
article](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/01/24/new-software-project-questions/)
on 15 questions to ask at the start of a new software project, that I thought
would be a useful exercise to complete for TinyDevCRM. So without further ado:

## Product Discovery

### 1. What problem are we trying to solve? Why?

> Custom software is not cheap. Be sure to evaluate why your customer is looking
> to dive into it in the first place. Create space for all stakeholders to
> respond, as there are likely many different perspectives behind "the why".

### 2. Is there a similar product on the market? If so, how will we differentiate from it?

> Benchmarking what other products exist is a great exercise to do during a
> Research, Design, and Planning phase. Use this time to understand how this
> product will be different. What value is it adding that others are lacking?

### 3. Are there other products or tools that we can, should, or need to integrate with?

> Does the product include a wearable device? Does it need to tie into other
> internal or external systems? Integrations will shape both the design and
> development approach, so knowing about them from the get-go is ideal.

## Business Discovery

### 4. What value are we providing to our business?

> Will the product help with sales? Will it provide impactful data? What is the
> reason our business is seeking to create the software?

### 5. What does success look like, and how will we measure it?

> Understanding expectations is crucial. Work with your team to create a shared
> understanding of what success is and how you might measure it.

### 6. What business risks or blockers exist?

> For example, is there a crucial integration that we need to work with IT on,
> but IT is booked out for 6 months? Is there a stakeholder who has the true
> vision of the product ,but they'll be on leave at the start of the project?

### 7. Who are the key stakeholders, and what kind of access will we have to them?

> Use this time to map out who your stakeholders are and set expectations for
> how engaged you will need them to be. How might you ensure the project never
> gets blocked from a lack of stakeholder feedback?

## User Discovery

### 8. Who will use the product?

> At the end of the day, we're building the software for people. Who are those
> people? What are their goals, motivations, and frustrations?

### 9. What value are we providing to users?

> Why would folks be inclined to use the tool we're creating? Understanding how
> we are providing value to users will help us determine which features to
> include and how to prioritize them.
