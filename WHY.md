# Why TinyDevCRM?

Recently, I read through [an article by Sarah Brockett on 15 questions to ask at
the start of a new software
project](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/01/24/new-software-project-questions/).
I think completing this exercise for TinyDevCRM would increase clarity and focus
around the tool's value proposition, both for myself and for others.

This has increased in importance over feedback from others on
[Pioneer.app](https://pioneer.app/) and [Y Combinator Startup School Winter
2020's Week 1 Group Session](https://www.startupschool.org) that TinyDevCRM's
value proposition is not clear, and over my inability to clarify certain
selling points and answer questions on the spot at that time.

This document should be tracked at all times via version control. Since the
`git` history is open-source, no `'last_modified'` date will be provided at this
time. Ideally, this document should achieve a "done" status, and is not intended
as a living document where shared understanding is continually updated.

## Product Discovery

### 1. What problem are we trying to solve? Why?

> Custom software is not cheap. Be sure to evaluate why your customer is looking

I'm building TinyDevCRM primarily for my own use cases. The two problems I have
coming into this project include how to keep track of my habits for the long
term, and how to keep in touch with my personal professional network.

This expounded into a broader thought process as to how I can build a platform
that could generalize these two use cases, and future-proof against any other
use cases that would crop up with respect to my personal development workflows,
and perhaps some work-related use cases as well (e.g. a client process to remind
me to rotate my personal passwords, and rotate my work-related AWS IAM keys, in
order to follow AWS security best practices, or a Google Home or
$SMART_DEVICE_OF_THE_DECADE client in order to keep track of my habits in
addition to the web client).

I found the most powerful commonalities between these use cases as:

- **Exposing (properly permissioned) access to relevant underlying data**

- **Maintaining some protocol to connect to third-party extensions**

- **Triggering events and notifying third-party processes of said events**

An application that can expose these three properties to a developer building a
client application, and reduce / remove the burden of having to build out a
separate data store, data management services, and server-side processes, may
drastically improve time-to-market or time-to-production for arbitrary clients,
and provide a central location for data management and prevent and/or preclude
data fragmentation and data discovery needs down the line.

### 2. Is there a similar product on the market? If so, how will we differentiate from it?

> Benchmarking what other products exist is a great exercise to do during a

> product will be different. What value is it adding that others are lacking?

This idea came into my mind during a conversation I had with an engineer at
Stripe around their favorite internal tooling. I'm not sure how much I should
say about their response in official writing, given how I have not been granted
explicit permission to share our private conversation publicly, but I will say
that their response greatly inspired this idea.

With respect to my immediate problem areas and discovery into platform
consolidation, here are some products that I've either used, tried out, or
looked at.

#### Habit Trackers

**[Productive](http://productiveapp.io/) (USED)**: Productive is a generic iOS
habit tracker. I've used the product now for about two years or so, and so there
are things I love about the product and things I don't like:

Pros:

-   **Native mobile support**: Productive is a native iOS application (vs.
    something like a [progressive web
    application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)),
    which means in-app push notifications (no need to install another native
    application like [Pushover](https://pushover.net/)), touch-first and
    swipe-first UI/UX, etc.

-   **Offline-first access**: I don't need to have an Internet network
    connection through cellular or Wi-Fi in order to access or use the
    application, since the master copy of the data is colocated with the
    application at all times. The application can go wherever my iPhone goes.
    This is a *huge* win in comparison to a purely Internet-based client.

-   **Forgiving UI/UX**: Unlike other habit trackers, Productive does not
    enforce default habits (you can start with however many habits makes you
    comfortable), doesn't set default habit behaviors (a habit follows a
    specific user-specified grammar and is marked on that basis, and each
    instance of that habit does not couple with other instances of that habit),
    does not limit the number of habits available (some habit tracker apps do
    this as a premium feature), and does not set hard deadlines as to when
    habits can be marked as completed or skipped.

    This forgiving nature makes it very easy to forgive yourself when you lapse
    in your habit, and empowers you to track your habits at your pace. This is
    likely the biggest reason I successfully onboarded and converted to the
    application in the first place, and conversely failed to convert to other
    platforms.

Cons:

-   **Application crashes and data loss**: Productive is highly secure, in the
    sense that data is colocated on the physical device, and only cloud-based
    iCloud and locally based iTunes backups are allowed. This comes at the cost
    of maintaining a unitary upgrade path, with severe consequences for data
    integrity.

    One problem with upgrading iOS applications is that downloading a fresh iOS
    application results in a different workflow than upgrading an existing iOS
    application. This means that cloud-based updates to the application, which
    their developers may mean to download from scratch, may not always work with
    older, existing deploys of the application. I'm sure the developers of
    Productive do their best, but on at least two occasions, an update bricked
    my application and I lost my data. Since I don't pay for iCloud, and since
    other cloud-based backup solutions are not available, and since I don't have
    a MacBook Pro available anymore for local iTunes backups (and I forgot the
    iTunes iPhone backup password), I couldn't restore the application to its
    prior state. This meant that all of my habits were simply lost and I had to
    start from scratch, which greatly disrupted my personal critical workflows.

    I would love to have a habit tracker that supports could-native backups,
    encrypted end-to-end and encrypted at-rest.

-   **Lack of third-party developer extensibility**: Productive.app is a closed
    environment with no available developer API. This means that additional
    analytics and view representations around habits cannot be tracked beyond
    what the app developers have provided. It also means that no extensions
    ecosystem is possible.

-   **Opaque underlying data representation**: I have no idea how my data is
    saved. I would not be surprised if a NoSQL backing, and the lack of highly
    structured migrations causes the application upgrade process to result in
    the data loss I've been experiencing.

-   **UI/UX changes**: I don't remember which founder said this (maybe from
    Basecamp, or Fog Creek, or MicroConf), but they said the only way in order
    to gain new sales and maintain / increase user conversion was to release a
    new version of their product with new features. Not tinkering with sales
    channels like advertising or referrals, or increasing customer support or
    refactoring existing features and increasing performance. For a tool like a
    habit tracker where I need something reliable and steady in a changing
    world, **this is absolutely a deal breaker**. There have been at least two
    jarring UX changes I've experienced through Productive. I understand they
    have families to feed and investors to please, and the changes aren't bad,
    it's just that for me in this specific context, I don't like change.

Ultimately, I found the cons to outweigh the pros. The data loss and lack of
visibility into the underlying data representation and confidence in application
upgrades prove especially egregious to my personal workflows. Considering how
much my personal workflow affects how effective I am at other parts of my life,
I consider it my top pressure point. I do think this application stands heads
and shoulders above everything else I've tried (which is why I gladly pay money
to Productive for usage of the application), but I think I've acquired enough
skills to take a shot at this problem myself.

#### To-Do Lists

**[Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) (USED)**: I've used Standard
Notes for a year and some change now, and I have almost no complaints. It's
proven so effective in my personal usage

Pros:

-   **Open-source and self-hostable**:

-   **Security-oriented**:

-   **Extensible**:

-   **Backups**:

-   **Support**:

Cons:

-   **Syncing could be better**: When there is a merge conflict between
    different versions of notes for Standard Notes, both

[Standard
    Notes](https://standardnotes.org/), another application I use, has a (paid?)
    feature to email a copy of the entire encrypted copy of your data to your
    email, with a single-file HTML tool to decrypt that data given the latest
    encryption key registered on your cloud account, that you can then load into
    your native application. This is ideally the standard that the habit tracker
    I use would meet or exceed.

-   **[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) (USED)**:

-   **[Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) (USED)**:

I realized that to-do lists target a different use case than a habit tracker.
Some of the key differences include:

#### CRMs

-   **[MonicaHQ](https://www.monicahq.com/) (LOOKED AT)**: This is the closest
    product I've found that represents something akin to what I want to build.
    Monica's goal is to help people build more meaningful relationships.
    Multiple people have recommended that I look into Monica HQ instead of
    building my own product, and their advice takes great credence.

    Ultimately, I decided to decline proceeding with paying for Monica or
    deploying my own instance of Monica. The honest, largest answer as to why is
    because by the time people recommended it to me my heart was already set on
    building my own CRM. However, there are a number of concerns I immediately
    had after reviewing the README:

    -   At **$9 / month**, the pricing seems both quite high in comparison to
        Productive (where I am paying $9 / year or **75 cents / month** for
        premium) and Standard Notes (where I paid $149 / five years or **$2.48 /
        month** for premium), and yet low enough where I'm concerned development
        may cease sometime in the future. As a point of reference, Slack (the
        web-based chat / collaboration tool) charges somewhere around $200 /
        user for low-grade enterprise plans:

        > “On Business Plus, $208.70 per user (850 Users, annual plan). It's an
        > unadvertised tier between business and enterprise that gives some
        > additional features, including the eDiscovery API for compliance.”
        >
        > [Capiche.com's post on Slack
        > pricing](https://www.capiche.com/e/slack-pricing)

        I believe that for B2B SaaS tools, large customers (or "whales") make up
        the majority of net profit, hence the shift for many SaaS companies to
        provide enterprise-friendly features over time (potentially at the cost
        of customer acquisition) as the product matures and achieves
        product/market fit.

### 3. Are there other products or tools that we can, should, or need to integrate with?

> Does the product include a wearable device? Does it need to tie into other
> internal or external systems? Integrations will shape both the design and
> development approach, so knowing about them from the get-go is ideal.

## Business Discovery

### 4. What value are we providing to our business?

> Will the product help with sales? Will it provide impactful data? What is the
> reason our business is seeking to create the software?

### 5. What does success look like, and how will we measure it?

> Understanding expectations is crucial. Work with your team to create a shared
> understanding of what success is and how you might measure it.

### 6. What business risks or blockers exist?

> For example, is there a crucial integration that we need to work with IT on,
> but IT is booked out for 6 months? Is there a stakeholder who has the true
> vision of the product ,but they'll be on leave at the start of the project?

### 7. Who are the key stakeholders, and what kind of access will we have to them?

> Use this time to map out who your stakeholders are and set expectations for
> how engaged you will need them to be. How might you ensure the project never
> gets blocked from a lack of stakeholder feedback?

## User Discovery

### 8. Who will use the product?

> At the end of the day, we're building the software for people. Who are those
> people? What are their goals, motivations, and frustrations?

### 9. What value are we providing to users?

> Why would folks be inclined to use the tool we're creating? Understanding how
> we are providing value to users will help us determine which features to
> include and how to prioritize them.

### 10. What risks exist if a poor-intentioned user has access to the product?

> Though we'd love to assume only well-intentioned people will use our software,
> the reality is that this may not be true. What kind of trouble could occur if
> a villainous persona gets their hands on our software? Determine what the
> risks are so we can design to mitigate them?

### 11. Will we have access to users for research and testing?

> Having access to users is crucial for validating the overall product and
> workflows we create. Be sure to begin the process of locating and scheduling
> time with users as soon as you can.

## Project Discovery

### 12. What key dates exist?

> Is there an event where someone hopes to demo the software? Is the software
> itself tied to a specific time of year? It's important to know if there are
> date-sensitive deliverables to ensure on-time delivery is achieved.

### 13. What are the expected deliverables?

> The detailed scope of the projet will shape over time, but at the start of a
> project, high-level deliverables should be determined. Is it a mobile app? Is
> it an API? Does part of the project include training and onboarding the
> customer's developers once the product is ready to hand off?

### 14. Who is the primary decision maker?

> At the end of the day, who gets to make the final decisions? This ideally
> should be one person, in order to avoid a decision paralysis or design by
> committee.

### 15. How might we best work together?

> What are the communication preferences across the team? Will you be working
> on-site together, or remotely? How often and to what capacity can and will
> your stakeholders be involved? Set the cadence for the project. I recommend
> setting up recurring calendar events early on, well before calendars get full
> and you become blocked on stakeholder feedback.

I'm currently working on this problem by myself, and since the product is for
myself, there's no feedback loops in order to release / ship product. The flip
side is this project may become rather lonely without external support and if I
don't ship at a fast enough speed. In order to combat this, I can do the
following:

- Publish a weekly stand-up thread, either on my personal techblog [Bytes by
  Ying](https://bytes.yingw787.com), or on a dedicated notes.tinydevcrm.com
  release website. The former might be easier to get started with, and the
  latter would be if there was signficant inertia in the project and a clear
  ability to monetize somehow (which again isn't a top priority for me).

- Continue to publish benchmarks on both [Pioneer.app](https://pioneer.app) and
  on [the Indie Hackers Daily Stand-up
  thread](https://www.indiehackers.com/group/daily-stand-up), and possibly ask
  folks for support or where they get sources of support there.

- Have a public issues dashboard or Kanban board where users would be able to
  (anonymously?) suggest feedback. Since I'm using GitHub at the moment, keeping
  track of issues on GitHub Issues would be a start. I can link to GitHub Issues
  from various points on TinyDevCRM, and ask around for the best automation /
  tooling / infrastructure FOSS maintainers use on GitHub Issues.

I'll likely have additional ways in order to establish feedback loops, but
having as much feedback and constructive criticism as frequently as possible is
critical to my professional development and to the success of this project.
After ensuring the proof of concept works and beginning the software development
lifecycle, establishing and exercising means of communications will be amongst
my highest priorities (#1 - #3).
